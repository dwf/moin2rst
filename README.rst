NAME

**moin2rst** -- convert a MoinMoin Wiki page to reStructuredText syntax

========
SYNOPSIS
========

Use MoinMoin action RenderAsRestructuredtext

   ``moin2rst.py [<option>]... page``

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

**moin2rst** contains a MoinMoin formatter plugin which formats a MoinMoin Wiki page as reStructuredText.

It is accompanied by a MoinMoin action plugin to use it inside a MoinMoin Wiki and by a script to be used from the command line.

Action RenderAsRestructuredtext
-------------------------------

If the action plugin is installed each page should come with an additional action RenderAsRestructuredtext in the list of possible actions. Using this action renders the page as ``text/x-rst`` and returns it to the browser where it can be saved for further use.

See INSTALLATION_ for instructions for installing the action plugin.

Command line interface
----------------------

The command line interface is implemented by ``moin2rst.py`` and can be used together with an existing Wiki installation.

See OPTIONS_ for the options of the script.

General options
---------------

-d dir, --directory=dir                Directory where the configuration file 
                                       of the wiki lives; defaults to '..'.

-r rev, --revision=rev                 Revision of the page to fetch (1-based),
                                       defaults to current revision.

-u template, --url-template=template   If the wiki given by 
                                       ``-d``/``--directory`` is 
                                       part of a wiki farm then this gives 
                                       a template to generate an URL from. 
                                       The URL must be matched 
                                       by one of the regular expressions 
                                       found in wikis in the respective 
                                       ``farmconfig.py``. May contain 
                                       at most one %. The % is replaced by 
                                       page to form a valid URL. If % is 
                                       omitted it is assumed at the end. 
                                       Defaults to the empty string.
